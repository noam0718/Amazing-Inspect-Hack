Hello! I'm Noam and I made all of these hacks for you. I noticed that a lot of people have been able to type on apps that you can't type on! Now, most other people do not know how to do that so on this repository, i'm going to show you how to enable a thing called, "inspect". Copy the link on my other file and you will be able to edit things on a site you cannot type on. Super cool! Copy this link, go to bookmarks, click add bookmark, then in the bottom corner, click more, and then finally, type in what you want to call it in the "name" box then take out the old URL and paste the one you copied. Good luck!

Enjoy!

(P.S. in order for my hacks to work, type in javascript: before you paste the code, EXCEPT FOR THE EDIT HACK!!!)
